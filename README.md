# Radicle Link ðŸŒ±

This is the working repo for the second iteration of the [Radicle] code
collaboration protocol.

**ðŸš¨ WORK IN PROGRESS ðŸš¨**

While `radicle-link` is currently being used in the [Upstream] application it is
under heavy development. If you came here from [Upstream], please note that it
may be pinned to an earlier commit than what you see here.

Pop into [#general on our Matrix server][matrix] for development updates.

## Build

Besides a Rust build environment (best obtained using [rustup]), you may need to
install the following packages on a Debian system:

* `file`
* `gcc`
* `git`
* `libc6-dev`
* `liblzma-dev`
* `libssl-dev`
* `make` (GNU make)
* `pkg-config`
* `zlib1g-dev`

For an up-to-date specification of the build and development toolchain, see the
[Dockerfile used for CI][docker].

To compile, run `cargo build`.
